				<h3 class="h3">About Table Tennis</h3>

				<p>Many people know ping-pong. It's the game that is usually played in the basement with an<br> opponent, with plastic paddles in hand that made the distinctive noises when a ball was struck. A<br> fun game it was, sort of like playing T-ball with huge yellow plastic bats or nerf football. But like<br> those two familiar games, ping-pong also has a real sport behind it.
				</p>

				<p>
				Table Tennis can be classified as a major sport worldwide, with millions of participants, major<br> tournaments(with its own superstars), and many other things that make a sport truly a class of its<br> own.
				</p>

				<p>
				As a sport that emphasizes endurance and reflexes above simple size and strength, people of all<br> ages and genders can play on an equal field. The equipment can be had for a reasonable price,<br> and the sport is played indoors so year-round competition and practice is possible. A game<br> requires only two players at the least, and typically lasts around 30 minutes, enabling quick<br> matches during breaks, etc.
				</p>

				<p>
				Table tennis truly is a sport for the masses, and its widespread adoption around the world is a<br> testament for its versatility. The United States has been lagging behind Europe and Asia in per<br> capita participation of table tennis as a sport. With enough enthusiasm and support, however, this<br> intense and exciting sport can succeed beside the old mainstays.
				</p>

				<p>
				The true origin of Table Tennis is largely unknown, although forms of the sport have been<br> documented as early as the late 1800s in England. The sport started becoming popular around the<br> world in the early 1900s. During this time, the official name of the sport was changed from Ping-<br>Pong™ to table tennis. This was due to copyright conflicts with Parker Brothers, who owned the<br> rights to the name and game of Ping-Pong™. The International Table Tennis Federation and United<br> States Table Tennis Association(later changed to United States Association of Table Tennis) were<br> formed at about this time. These organizations would go on to become the primary ruling bodies of<br> table tennis.
				</p>

				<p>
				Table tennis has evolved significantly since its surprise birth upon the sporting world, acquiring<br> many revisions of rules and seeing an evolution of equipment as technology and playing styles<br> changed. Such refinement only serves as evidence that table tennis is indeed a full-fledged sport,<br> comparable to any of the other classics we behold with reverence.
